# Your Project's Name

My project is about building a future-ready and job-ready e-Portfolio for myself. Why is an e-Portfolio important you may ask, well, its because an e-Portfolio allows someone to not only showcase what they have done in the past, but also a good representation of how they present it. Hence, I want to build an e-Portfolio to be future-ready and gain some learning experiences from it.
 
## Design Process

- As a potential employer, I want to find out more about my client, so that I can make a good judgement to hire them.
  - Building a good portfolio can attract more employers, and placing a portfolio on the web allows us to have a wider exposure to people who are looking to hire others
Hence, I try to put in as much information about myself as I can to suit their requirements that they are looking for, and if they still have queries they can contact me

## Features

In my "About Me" page, I have linked my LinkedIn page at the start, so people can find out more about my Resume. In the same page, I have also included projects which I have partaken in and also a short introduction about myself. In my "Educations and Qualifications page, I included the institutions which I have studied in and are studying in now and links to their websites and what I have accomplished in those schools. The "Hobbies and Interests" allows me to present my views on the things I enjoy doing. Finally, "Contact Me" is to submit a form to contact me and inormation about myself.
 
### Existing Features
- forms to contact me
- carousel to showcase projects done
- interests and hobbies in a page
- list to showcase schools attended

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
- AI feature to answer FAQs
- a gameified way to browse my portfolio to intrigue potential employers
  - maybe a way to represent how I have grown throughout my life

### Features Left to Implement
- More sophisticated way to show projects and achievements
  - wanted to show with a slideshow like presentation style but was unable to perfect it
- my doodling website which I plan to do in the future

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [owl.carousel.min.js](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/.)
    - the extention was created to simplify the owl carousell function for jQuery
- [fonts]
    - external fonts were used


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Me" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears

- in the mobile version of my contact form, I am unable to resize my text area as it would make the input look weird if i change it in my media

2. Carousel
   1. Go to the "About Me" page
   2. Scroll to the "Experiences" section
   3. Click on the links and check if they work

- I also had many errors when I was doing this project, which led me to many hours spent on debugging. It was a painful process but I learnt alot from my mistakes and will try to avoid these kinds of errors in the future, which include: alignment errors, file directory errors, coding syntax errors and many other small but critical mistakes made
- I am glad that I made these mistakes though, as it helps and reminds me on why and how I should avoid and not make them again

### Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from a YouTube tutorial from DailyTuition, which taught me alot more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript in ways I could not imagine. How these 3 coding languages work in harmony to form a functioning website.
